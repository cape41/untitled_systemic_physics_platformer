DISCLAIMER: This project is lisenced under a source available licence. I am distributing the source code on this public repository to allow people to learn from my code or help me with development. Read more below.

Hi all! This is an experiment for a physics based platform-style game. I'm trying to create systems with loads of emergent behaviour. :)

LICENCE TERMS:
 - this project is under a source available licence, meaning I grant no permissions to sell my game or redistribute it off-platform. Nevertheless, if you would like to modify my game, I am happy to allow this as long as the modification is redistrobuted on Github, linked back to me and does not contain anything sketchy. I reserve my right to take down your project at any time.
