# untitled_systemic_physics_platformer
Hi all! This is an experiment for a physics based platform-style game. I'm trying to create systems with loads of emergent behaviour. :)

LICENCE TERMS:
 - this project is under a source available licence, meaning I grant no permissions to sell my game or redistribute it off-platform. Nevertheless, if you would like to modify my game, I am happy to allow this as long as the modification is redistributed on Github, linked back to me and does not contain anything sketchy. I reserve my right to take down your project at any time.
 - Also, let me know if y'all'd like a cut back version of the project under a less restrictive licence. I am hesitant to make this version FOSS as I am planning to develop it into a commercial game if it is successful, but I might consider releasing a version with just the underlying physics systems / character controller
 - I am distributing the source code on this public repository to allow people to learn from my code or help me with development
